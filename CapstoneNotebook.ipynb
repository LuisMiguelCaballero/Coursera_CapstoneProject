Looking for an apartment made me realize that it is an exhausting process and there are a lot of different variables that someone must consider like cost, location, if the campus is nearby, if there are supermarkets or coffee shops nearby, etc. It will great to use clustering to help me, and other future students, to search for the best neighborhoods available. Also it will be really helpful if the best and worst neighborhoods can be shown in a map. This clustering method can help a lot of future students seeking for a great apartment.   \n"
